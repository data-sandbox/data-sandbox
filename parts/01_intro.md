## 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my digital sandbox! I'm a mixtape of data scientist, software developer, and mechanical engineer - all rolled up into one unique remix! 📊💻🛠

### 🕵️ What I'm currently learning:

- Energy market analysis methods (Such as open-source Python production cost models like [Switch](https://github.com/switch-model/switch)) ⚡️
- Life cycle assessment (LCA) and Techno-economic analysis (TEA) methods and tools 💸
- Battery energy storage systems and their projected growth ([Article](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/enabling-renewable-energy-with-battery-energy-storage-systems), [IRENA](https://www.irena.org/Publications/2019/Sep/Enabling-Technologies)) 🔋
